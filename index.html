      <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in Colorado and spent lots of time in the mountains camping, hiking and playing in the snow. I went to school in Denver at the Art Institute of Colorado and earned a degree in photography. After graduation, my wife and I moved to New York City so I could pursue a career in photography. We loved the city but after a couple years we realized it wasn't for us, so we moved across the country again to Seattle. We've lived here ever since and love the Northwest!

    <h2>Goals and Dreams</h2>
      <p>
        I would love to spend winters living in a hut deep in the mountians where I can ski from my door. If I could own and operate a backcountry ski lodge, I would be in heaven! In the meantime, I hope to gain the skills needed to land me a good job in the tech industry.
